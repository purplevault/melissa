# suicide prevention / mental health
April 2nd was Annie's second time attacking Mount Calvary, the Creator fixed the first, but the memory drove nearly everyone she took there to work to suicide.

Annie severely DOWNGRADED the method of killing to beheading, which leaves a memory in the victims they cannot ever overcome.  Thats why the Creator cannot undo April 2nd.  If He were to undo it the victims would actually spend the rest of their days trying to commit suicide some of them never understanding why.

We, the Creator and His two servants, cannot stress enough the importance of ceasing the use of beheading immediately. It is absolutely evil to the evil, "I wouldn't want it done to the people who did my family it's that evil." - micah

Those who went to Kentucky for work need to understand there's a lot of trauma that happened to them, the worker. the company knew this and they are expecting you to commit suicide. we hope that you do not and urge you to get some assistance and dealing with the trauma that happened to you. 

If you're wondering where you can get assistance, see [this answer](https://github.com/purplevault/melissa/discussions/3) in the Q&A.
