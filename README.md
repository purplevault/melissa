# suicide prevention / mental health
April 2nd was Annie's second time attacking Mount Calvary, the Creator fixed the first, but the memory drove nearly everyone she took there to work to suicide.

Annie severely DOWNGRADED the method of killing, which leaves a memory in the victims they cannot ever overcome   Thats why the Creator cannot undo April 2nd.

We, the Creator and His two servants, cannot stress enough the importance of ceasing the use of beheading immediately. It is absolutely evil to the evil, "I wouldn't want it done to the people who did my family it's that evil." - micah
